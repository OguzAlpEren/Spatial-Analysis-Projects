## Overview
This repository showcases a series of advanced spatial analysis projects conducted using QGIS, focusing on real-world data and applications in demographic, environmental, and socioeconomic contexts. Each project involved statistical and geographic analysis techniques without the use of code, demonstrating expertise in QGIS workflows, data handling, and analytical visualization.

## Project Descriptions

### Homework 1: Intro to QGIS – Demographic Mapping
**[Black and White Population in Maryland and Pennsylvania (Quantile Classification)](./GIS-HW1-Oguz-Alp-Eren.pdf)**  
Explored racial demographics in Maryland and Pennsylvania, creating quantile-based choropleth maps to represent the distributions of Black and White populations. Analysis revealed contrasting spatial patterns, highlighting areas of demographic concentration and racial integration.

### Homework 2: Points, Polygons, Spatial Joins, and Buffers
**[Bookstore Accessibility in New York State](./GIS-HW2-Oguz-Alp-Eren.pdf)**  
Analyzed bookstore locations with 5-km buffer zones to assess accessibility disparities across New York. Socioeconomic factors such as income and population density were examined to determine correlations with bookstore presence, underscoring urban-rural divides and potential demographic impacts on access to educational resources.

### Homework 3: Centrographic Statistics and Demographic Patterns
**[Mean Centers and Standard Deviational Ellipses](./GIS-HW3-Oguz-Alp-Eren.pdf)**  
Mapped mean centers and standard deviational ellipses for various demographics across the U.S., including elderly populations and Black Americans, using centrographic techniques. The analysis highlighted spatial tendencies for different groups, providing insights into historical and regional population distributions.

### Homework 5: Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis
**[Tree Density and Demographic Correlations in NYC](./GIS-HW5-Oguz-Alp-Eren.pdf)**  
Examined NYC’s tree density relative to demographic and socioeconomic factors, using census and street tree data to explore environmental equity. Identified spatial patterns suggesting disparities in green space distribution, with implications for environmental justice across NYC neighborhoods.

### Homework 6: Spatial Autocorrelation and Regression Models
**[Spatial Regression Analysis on NYC’s Black Population and Tree Density](./GIS-HW6-Oguz-Alp-Eren.pdf)**  
Employed spatial lag and error models to investigate autocorrelation in NYC’s Black population distribution relative to tree density. Findings indicated significant clustering patterns, reflecting potential environmental disparities across neighborhoods.

### Homework 7: Comprehensive Spatial Diagnostics
**[In-Depth Spatial Regression and Environmental Justice Analysis](./GIS-HW7-Oguz-Alp-Eren.pdf)**  
This project combined Ordinary Least Squares, Spatial Lag, and Spatial Error models to analyze the correlation between NYC’s Black population and tree density, adjusted for socioeconomic variables. The results suggested spatial clustering of environmental disparities, emphasizing the need for equitable urban planning.
